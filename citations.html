                             “Sweet Comparisons: How Much Sugar Is in That Drink?” CNN, Cable News Network, 30 June 2015, www.cnn.com/2014/07/02/health/gallery/sugar-sweetened-beverages/index.html.
	                           Another news article in a more graphic format provides concrete numbers as to how sugary soft drinks can be and compares them to sugary treats. Citations are explicitly stated before the slideshow. This was used in both the paper and visual.

	                           This book used in the paper also illustrates how slavery helped finance the Industrial Revolution in England along with how the slave trade allowed sugar barons to accumulate vast fortunes, to establish heavy infrastructure, and banks to spread Capitalism worldwide. It provides a critical commentary on Imperialism with a moral argument. Williams has an educational background from Oxford with his advanced research in history.
