                      Towards the end of the 18th century, a fundamental social and economic transformation arose:  the Industrial Revolution. Led by England, the Industrial Revolution recast primarily agricultural Europe into ever-urbanizing industrial societies fueled by capitalism, overseas trade, growing consumption and changing mores (Strayer 829-831). Technological innovations, most notably the cotton gin, the spinning jenny, and the steam engine, transformed how English cotton was produced. What was so revolutionary about the Industrial Revolution may be subsumed under three principles:  the substitution of machines for human skill and effort,  the substitution of “inanimate forms over animate sources of power,” (Mintz 45), in particular, the introduction of engines for converting heat into work, and the use of new and far more abundant raw materials (Abbott 62).  The nature of work changed.  Instead of working in one’s home with family members to produce what one needed to survive, factories sprung up where labor, productivity, wages and working conditions were all controlled, and social life changed drastically (Abbott 64).

                      Rural workers were forced off the land by the Enclosure Acts of 1760 and 1830 and crammed into cities scarcely able to accommodate them. Poverty forced women and children into the factories. In their former agrarian life, most laborers had access to gardens where they could grow their own vegetables, fruit, or raise livestock. However, in the cities affected by the enclosure laws, workers had to purchase their food and often had to change their diets in response to cost and availability. On the other hand, for one of the first times in history, those not in the royal court had access to non-European foodstuffs, previously restricted to the privileged class, such as rice, maize, tea, coffee, chocolate, and sugar (Abbott 64). By 1680, sugar cost only half what it had in 1630. By 1700, the percentage of imported foodstuffs had doubled from 16.9 percent to 34.9 percent, with brown sugar and molasses being the most popular (Abbott 63).  Although the population did not change significantly from 1663 to 1775, England and Wales consumed sixty times more sugar than before, greatly outstripping the foodstuffs of bread, meat, and dairy products (Mintz, 67).  Mintz explains that sugared tea breaks proved to be a key element in how factories managed and motivated their workforces. Tea breaks came about because new industrialized production changed proletarian work schedules and tea breaks gave the working classes “new tasting opportunities and new occasions for eating and drinking,” (141). Sugar played the nefarious role of opiate for the people. It was a psychologically addictive substance that energized and delighted; it deadened appetites and satisfied hunger pangs, and; it opened up new possibilities, such as candy, of consumption and social respectability previously unattainable to all but the privileged classes.
