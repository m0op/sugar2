                      In the 21rst century, an immense political battle is arising against the sugar industry and the sugar food establishment. Sugars ground from hills of sugar beets or cane as well as boiled from fields of corn make up the 360,000 metric tons that it takes to satisfy America’s sweet tooth (Big Sugar, 45:09). Sugar goes through an industrial process that removes all fiber and minerals, and is bleached leaving only sucrose. The average person in the Western world consumes consumes 125 lbs of sugar every year, mostly hidden in processed food and drink (Big Sugar, 45:25). The sheer quantity makes sugar a key suspect in the worldwide obesity crisis. Sugar barons deny any connection, however the companies are worried about lawsuits for the way they deliberately manipulate their sugar marketing, even to the very young (Big Sugar 46:10).  Sugars are in peanut butter, bread, hot dogs, yogurt, soup, bacon, cough syrup, salami, cold cuts, ketchup, Ritz crackers, tomato juice, Coca Cola, orange juice, baby food, and even in some cigarettes (Abbott 278).  In many places, Coca Cola or Pepsi is priced lower than bottled water (Firger, 1), which gives way to the enormously successful industry lobbying. The consumption of soft drinks in North America since 1950 has increased by 500 percent (Big Sugar 51:59). More than 50% of teenagers consume at least one soft drink a day, unaware of the astronomical amounts of sugar within them. With the almost 40g of sugar in an average Coca cola can (“Sweet Comparisons”, 1), one could call soft drinks a dessert or candy. Soft drink companies have managed to install themselves as popular icons, rather than the nutritional implications.

                     In Geneva at the headquarters of the UN’s World Health Organization, delegates are facing an unexpected crisis: the obesity epidemic. For the first time in human history, there are more overweight and obese people in the world than hungry people (Big Sugar 55:15).  The evidence that sugar is playing a starring role in the epidemic is a sensitive and controversial issue precisely because the sugar industry insists that there is no empirical proof that if one gorges on sugar, weight is gained as a consequence. Harvard Medical School tracked the consumption of soft drinks of 548 children for 19 months: the results of which being that the sugars in one can a day were enough to add 10lbs of body weight a year, and more than one can increases the chance of obesity by 60 percent (Ludwig, 1).  Sugar not only is suspected to cause obesity, but maturity onset diabetes (type 2). The consequences of the excess gorging of sugar include how people lose their limbs, go blind early, get cardiovascular disease, lose their kidneys, and even causes death. As of 2010 worldwide, diabetes kills 3.2 million people a year (Big Sugar 1:00:02), or 8,700 a day, or six people every minute.  Eighteen million children under the age of five are overweight and the number of overweight teenagers has tripled since 1980. A new kind of sugar slavery arrived with diabetes as a fatal consequence: the obesity epidemic.
