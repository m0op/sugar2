                      The Africanization of sugar was one of the darkest hours in the sugar industry’s history.  Slaves were crammed in tight ships in insufferable conditions from their forced transfer from their homeland, often dying of disease or suicide, until they arrived at their plantations emaciated and broken. Plantations were self-contained villages with dozens of buildings. These included a mill, boiling and curing houses, sheds in which to repair and maintain equipment, and storage sheds and barns for the cane, its leavings and for livestock and plantation supplies (Abbott 80).  They operated with factory-like scheduling and job specialization. Sidney Mintz proposes that they were the first to institute assembly line production (87).  Whippings were often public spectacles as warnings to other slaves (see visual). Black drivers had to whip their victims under white supervision for disobedience. The slave-sugar complex was all pervasive. It supported important industries such as   building and provisioning slave ships and manufacturing the items to be traded for Africans (Abbott 149). Sugar slavery was in many ways one of the most deadly forms of slavery.  Cutting cane by hand was and still is one of the hardest forms of labor on Earth (Big Sugar 27:11) , with slaves for the most part being worked to death at a fairly early age. Work on the sugar mills was also quite arduous and dangerous, because the mills operated with large wooden rollers for cane to be fed through. If one becomes tired or careless after a 13- or 14-hour shift and places his hand accidently near the rollers, there was someone nearby with a hatchet to chop off the arm so that the slave’s whole body wouldn’t get carried through (Abbott 133). Many with their measly wages shopped for basic items at and owed money to the company store that  included obscene markups (Abbott 134).

                      In addition, it generated employment, albeit notoriously underpaid and coerced, for seamen. Sugar slavery provided jobs manufacturing the items every plantation needed in its arsenal, including the iron collars, handcuffs and shackles, tongue depressors and ball-and-chains originally designed for medieval torture chambers. Sugar works needed brass fittings for the boiling house, iron sugar stoves and cane crushing rollers,  iron hoes and agricultural books, pens and inks and reams of paper for the overseers and other managers, and bolts of linen and cheap cotton, shoes, ribbons, buttons, thread, and other notions for slaves (Abbott 150). The nature of plantation-style sugar production forced planters into the world of high finance and commerce. They needed capital, credit, exporting and importing expertise, insurance and customs and commercial contacts to finance and operate their sugar estates (Abbott 156). The slave-sugar complex operated on triangular routes between the metropolis, the African Slave Coast, and the sugar colonies in the Americas, then back to the metropolis. Specifically, Europe traded its finished goods for African slaves who were transported and sold to its West Indian colonies (see visual), which supplied these colonies with refined sugar, cloth, tools and other manufactured goods. This triangle satisfied the requirements of mercantilism, the “post-medieval economic system premised on the need for bullion accumulation achieved through balances of trade that favored the metropolis and its industries at the expense of subservient colonies and their raw produce,” (Mintz 98).  Eric Williams argues that the triangular trade contributed so heavily to British industrial development that its profits “fertilized the entire reproductive system of the country” and “made an enormous contribution to Britain's industrial development” (65). The combined needs of one planter or manager and ten of his black workers, including their food-stuffs, clothing and tools, provided jobs for four men in England, and every sugar worker out-produced every English worker in a ratio of 130 to 1. The combined wealth of the sugar plantations was anywhere from 50 million to 70 million pounds (Abbott 151).  Barbados was more valuable to British capitalism than the vastly larger colonies of New England, New York, and Pennsylvania combined. British demand for sugar created gargantuan capital, fueled manufacturing, encouraged imperial ventures, helped finance its wars and enriched both its “nation’s coffers and its people,” (qtd. in Abbott 152). Britain's lead in starting one of the key global transformations of the modern period is illustrated through the bringing of thousands of people to the Americas, including enabling capitalism by exploiting disenfranchised masses to create the goods that support such economic systems. Exploitable labor is imperative to the initial growth of capitalism to become a viable alternative to other economic systems through its ability to create the initial goods and services needed to sell to others with little cost, allowing things to be bought and sold at a price that is reasonable for consumers to own and for business owners to make a profit off of. As capitalism grows and so does a nation’s GDP, people are able to afford to pay for products made with paid labor rather than slavery and manufacturing infrastructure is pre existing, allowing for new business owners to be able to afford paying their workers.
