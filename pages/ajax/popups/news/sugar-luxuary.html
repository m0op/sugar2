                      	Sugar cane originated from the Arab World via the Venetians. They were the great sugar aggregators of their time, buying it from the Middle East and distributing it to other European nations (BBC Worldwide 1:24-2:01) collecting a large premium and introducing sugar as a treat enjoyed by those who could afford the high prices, such as royal palaces. Sugar in the Early Modern Period was very much a “symbol of status” (BBC Worldwide 1:51), and was often used as a medium for arts, such as sculpture. Those outside of the palace ate food to sustain themselves, but those within the royal court used sugar to help illuminate their lavish lifestyle, adding decadence to their food and showing off. One of the first recorded royal requests for sugar was by Henry III, who stated “if so much is to be had,” in referring to his order of 3 lbs of sugar (qtd. BBC Worldwide 3:30-3:34), which implied that there was so little sugar within the kingdom that 3 lbs was a selfish demand even for a king.
