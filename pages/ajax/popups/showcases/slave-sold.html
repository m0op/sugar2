                       Slaves were crammed in tight ships in insufferable conditions from their forced transfer from their homeland, often dying of disease or suicide, until they arrived at their plantations emaciated and broken. Plantations were self-contained villages with dozens of buildings. These included a mill, boiling and curing houses, sheds in which to repair and maintain equipment, and storage sheds and barns for the cane, its leavings and for livestock and plantation supplies (Abbott 80).  They operated with factory-like scheduling and job specialization. Whippings were often public spectacles as warnings to other slaves (see visual). Black drivers had to whip their victims under white supervision for disobedience.

                             The slave-sugar complex operated on triangular routes between the metropolis, the African Slave Coast, and the sugar colonies in the Americas, then back to the metropolis. Specifically, Europe traded its finished goods for African slaves who were transported and sold to its West Indian colonies (see visual), which supplied these colonies with refined sugar, cloth, tools and other manufactured goods. This triangle satisfied the requirements of mercantilism, the “post-medieval economic system premised on the need for bullion accumulation achieved through balances of trade that favored the metropolis and its industries at the expense of subservient colonies and their raw produce,” (Mintz 98).  Eric Williams argues that the triangular trade contributed so heavily to British industrial development that its profits “fertilized the entire reproductive system of the country” and “made an enormous contribution to Britain's industrial development” (65).

                             The combined needs of one planter or manager and ten of his black workers, including their food-stuffs, clothing and tools, provided jobs for four men in England, and every sugar worker out-produced every English worker in a ratio of 130 to 1. The combined wealth of the sugar plantations was anywhere from 50 million to 70 million pounds (Abbott 151).  Barbados was more valuable to British capitalism than the vastly larger colonies of New England, New York, and Pennsylvania combined. British demand for sugar created gargantuan capital, fueled manufacturing, encouraged imperial ventures, helped finance its wars and enriched both its “nation’s coffers and its people,” (qtd. in Abbott 152).
