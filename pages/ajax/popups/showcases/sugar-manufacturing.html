                       Plantations were self-contained villages with dozens of buildings. These included a mill, boiling and curing houses, sheds in which to repair and maintain equipment, and storage sheds and barns for the cane, its leavings and for livestock and plantation supplies (Abbott 80).  They operated with factory-like scheduling and job specialization. Sidney Mintz proposes that they were the first to institute assembly line production (87). Cutting cane by hand was and still is one of the hardest forms of labor on Earth (Big Sugar 27:11) , with slaves for the most part being worked to death at a fairly early age. Work on the sugar mills was also quite arduous and dangerous, because the mills operated with large wooden rollers for cane to be fed through. If one becomes tired or careless after a 13- or 14-hour shift and places his hand accidently near the rollers, there was someone nearby with a hatchet to chop off the arm so that the slave’s whole body wouldn’t get carried through (Abbott 133).

                            Nowadays,  sugar goes through an industrial process that removes all fiber and minerals, and is bleached leaving only sucrose.  Sugars are in peanut butter, bread, hot dogs, yogurt, soup, bacon, cough syrup, salami, cold cuts, ketchup, Ritz crackers, tomato juice, Coca Cola, orange juice, baby food, and even in some cigarettes (Abbott 278).
